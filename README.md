LM75 Arduino & ESP32 Library

Description  
This library provides an easy-to-use interface for the LM75 temperature sensor. It allows you to read temperature data via the I2C interface and includes additional features like over-temperature alerts and integration with various Arduino and ESP32 projects.  
The library is designed for students, educators, and hobbyists working on projects that require precise temperature readings.

Example Code  
Below is a basic example of how to use the library to read temperature in Celsius:

#include <LM75_elec4u_co_il.h>

LM75_elec4u_co_il lm75(0x48); // Default I2C address for LM75

void setup()  
{  
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize Serial Monitor  
  lm75.begin();       // Initialize the LM75 sensor  
}  

void loop()  
{  
  float temperature = lm75.readTemperature(); // Read the temperature  
  Serial.print("Temperature: ");  
  Serial.print(temperature);  
  Serial.println(" Â°C");  
  delay(1000); // Wait 1 second before the next reading  
}
